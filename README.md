# GroupMeAnalyzer-v2

To run this app you will need to get an access token from GroupMe. That can be done here: https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/oauth

Once you have the access token you have two options:

- If you plan on building the app yourself, then paste the access token into the App.config file.
- If you just want to run the .exe, then paste the access token into the bin/Release/GroupMeAnalytics.exe.config file

The app should now be able to make the necessary API calls.

The app will cache all messages from the server in a file that is specifed in the config file.
